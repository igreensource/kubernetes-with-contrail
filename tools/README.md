* vrouter-restart.sh
 * Vrouter won't reload objects from the contrail if it restarts for any reason. Run this script on a node to reload the config from the controller.

* purge.sh
 * Remove all objects from contrail controller that have been created by kube-network-manager. Effectively a clean slate.
